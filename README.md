# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
Complete the election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections for a recent congressional election.
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast and complete list of candidates who received votes.
2. Calculate total number of votes per candidate to determine percentage of vote received.
3. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
4. Calculate voter turnout for each county.
5. Determine the county with the highest voter turnout.

## Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.9.7, Visual Studio Code 1.65.2

## Outcomes
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- Arapahoe County made up 6.7% of the votes with 24,801 votes.
- Jefferson County made up 10.5% of the votes with 38,855 votes.
- Denver County had the largest voter turnout at 82.8% with 306,055 votes.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
 - The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes.
    - Dianne DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes.
 - The winner of the election was Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 votes.
 
## Summary 
Now that this script has been created it could be used for any number of elections.  The code could remain as is and simply add in additional CSV files for other counties.  This script could be made more robust to include additional indices when gathering voter information across states, as well as, counties. This code could also be modified to output additional information as necessary.  One such example could be deteriming the percentage of candidate votes by county.
